# Tabber

Web application in the works for writing music for stringed instruments in tab notation.

## Development Releases
Development releases are currently being deployed to [Github Pages](https://benjamin-warner.github.io/Tabber/). There is minimal attention to UI currently as basic functionality is currently top priority until a significant amount of *quality of life* features are deployed. At this point, the Github Pages site is likely to be replaced with an Alpha release.

To view a kanban of on-going progress, check out Tabber's [Trello](https://trello.com/b/r3t3NSyr/tabber).

**These releases are _unstable._**
