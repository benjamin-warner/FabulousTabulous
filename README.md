# Tabber

Webapp in the works for writing music for stringed instruments in tab notation.

## In-Development Release
In-development releases currently being deployed to [Github Pages](https://benjamin-warner.github.io/Tabber/). There is minimal attention to UI currently as basic functionality is currently top priority until a significant amount of *quality of life* features are deployed.
**These releases are _unstable._**
