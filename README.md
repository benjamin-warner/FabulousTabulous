# Tabber

Web application in the works for writing music for guitar in tab notation.

## Development Releases
*Development releases are unstable!*

Development releases are currently being deployed to Github Pages :point_right: [here](https://benjamin-warner.github.io/Tabber/) :point_left:

There is minimal attention to UI currently as basic functionality is top priority until more *quality of life* features are developed.

To view a kanban of on-going progress, check out Tabber's [Trello](https://trello.com/b/r3t3NSyr/tabber).
